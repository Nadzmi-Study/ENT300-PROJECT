# ENT300-PROJECT
A project for ENT300 subject during my studies in UiTM Kedah

Actually I recreate this project to unlock or lock a door using text.
This time, I recreate the project but with some customization.

CUSTOMIZATION :
  -	The door can be locked or unlocked using android apps. User only has to press the lock or unlock buttons.
  -	The communication mechanism I used is client/server connection through IP address. So, the user can lock or unlock the door anywhere he/she wanted through internet.
  -	I'll try to include the camera control into the project so that I can know if an anonymous person wants to break in my room.

*Maybe you're asking me, "Why did the user want to unlock the door when he/she are not around his/her house?".

 EXPLAINATION :
 
 I'm not a good at remembering things, I always left my keys in the house. So, I can open the door even if I does not have my keys around me. This gives benefit for me and both of my roomates(I'm staying hostel) because even if I'm around my house, I can easily open the lock of my house for my friend.
